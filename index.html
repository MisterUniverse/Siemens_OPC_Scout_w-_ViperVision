    <h1>Testing using Siemens OPC Scout</h1>
    <p>
        When you first open OPC Scout, located in the "Server Explorer" section you should see a list of "COM" servers 
        and a list of "UA" servers. In the "COM" server section you will need to expand the "Local COM server" option.
    </p>
    <img src="images/LocalCOM.PNG" />
    <p>
        After expanding the "Local COM server" menu, a list of local OPC/COM servers should appear if the servers are currently running.
    </p>
    <img src="images/ServerList.PNG"/>
    <p>From that list we are using two servers. Those are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>OPC.SimaticNET</li>
        <li>ViperImaging.Opc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using OPC Scout we can test communication of these servers via Siemens Mechanisms.
        First we will start by expanding the "OPC.SimaticNET" server menu and finding the directory labeled "\PNIO:".
    </p>

    <p>Once the "\PNIO:" directory is found expand it. Then expand the "ctrl1" directory and then the "aliases" directory.</p>

    <p>
        From here you will notice a list of tags that have been aliased to familiar names. 
        We are now going to set up a "DA view" for testing and viewing the results.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the top right hand corner, click "File" from the context menu of OPC Scout, and then select "New Project". 
            What this does is creates a new "DA view" project inside of OPC Scout. It may ask if you want to save any changes just 
            select no and it will open up the new "DA view" with the label "DA view 1".
        </li>
        <li>
            From our OPC server that is open in the Server Explorer, select one of the aliased tag names, 
            like "Injection_Number", and drag/drop it down to the empty "DA view 1" project tab.
            <img src="images/step2.PNG" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
            Now that we have a tag selected in our new "DA view" project we can attempt to Read/Write or Generate/Monitor 
            the data exchange on that server. Try reading data from the server by clicking the "Read" button.
            <img src="images/result.PNG" alt="">
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In the "Result" section of the "DA view" project you should get an "OK" result for good signals or 
        if there was a problem the result would be a "FAIL".
        You can drag down as many of the aliased tags as you like and try them all at once. 
        Try following these steps with both the "OPC.SimaticNET" server and the "ViperImaging.OPC" server.
    </p>
